        "You are growing fast, but your house is still a little bit behind. It's time to find a home that matches your new success and your new life.",
        "You should be proud! You've come a long way. Now we just need to make sure your front door says 'I made it!' to the whole world.",

    <p><strong>Where you are strong:</strong> You are really good at the "${pillars[highIdx]}" part of your move. This means you have a very clear picture in your head of what you want. This is your "superpower"—it will help you stay excited even when things get busy!</p>
    
    <p><strong>What we can work on:</strong> Sometimes, the "${pillars[lowIdx]}" stuff can feel a bit scary or confusing. That is totally okay! Right now, your heart is ready to move, but your brain just needs a little more help with the plan. It's like building a big Lego castle—we just need to make sure the bottom blocks are extra strong before we start building the towers.</p>
    
    <p><strong>The Next Step:</strong> You are ready to stop guessing and start knowing for sure. Don't worry about knowing everything today. My job is to help you put the pieces together so you can move forward without any stress. Let's look at your roadmap together!</p>
