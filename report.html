            <p><strong>Your Strength:</strong> You are really good at knowing what you want! You took the time to think about your future, and that is a very smart thing to do. Many people rush into things, but you are being careful and wise.</p>
            
            <p><strong>The Next Step:</strong> Right now, your biggest job is to look at your "Logical Foundation." This just means making sure the math matches your dreams. It's like building a Lego house—we want to make sure the bottom part is very strong so the top part doesn't fall over.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Simple Advice:</strong> Don't let the big numbers scare you. Think of this move like a bridge. On one side is where you are now, and on the other side is your new happy home. We just need to walk across the bridge one step at a time.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Sean's Commendation:</strong> I am very proud of you for finishing this. It shows you care about your family and your future. You are ready to stop guessing and start knowing!</p>
