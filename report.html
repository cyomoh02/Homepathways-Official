            <p><strong>You did a great job!</strong> Just by finishing this, you are already ahead of most people[cite: 1, 41]. You took the time to think about your future, and that is a very smart thing to do. You should be very proud of yourself for being brave enough to ask these big questions!</p>
            
            <p><strong>Where you are strong:</strong> You are really good at the "${pillars[highIdx]}" part of your move. This means you have a very clear picture in your head of what you want[cite: 4, 122]. This is your "superpower"—it will help you stay excited even when things get busy!</p>
            
            <p><strong>What we can work on:</strong> Sometimes, the "${pillars[lowIdx]}" stuff can feel a bit scary or confusing. That is totally okay! Right now, your heart is ready to move, but your brain just needs a little more help with the plan[cite: 14, 218]. It's like building a big Lego castle—we just need to make sure the bottom blocks are extra strong before we start building the towers.</p>
            
            <p><strong>The Next Step:</strong> You are ready to stop guessing and start knowing for sure[cite: 82, 123]. Don't worry about knowing everything today. My job is to help you put the pieces together so you can move forward without any stress. Let's look at your roadmap together!</p>
